## 👋 About

U.S. military veteran on a second chapter. After 15 years away from tech, I'm back — pursuing a cybersecurity degree and building AI governance systems in my spare time.

Four months into this journey, I've architected OLYMPUS: a full-stack governance framework with 6,000+ graph nodes, multi-layer service architecture, and novel approaches to AI context management.

💡 Recovery taught me that systems need guardrails — including AI systems.
