## 🔨 What I'm Building

### 🏛️ OLYMPUS
Full-stack AI governance framework. 6,000+ graph nodes. Multi-layer service architecture with Greek mythology naming because "PYTHIA cannot recommend" is more memorable than "the inference service cannot recommend."

- 🧠 Cognitive layer (observe/advise, never execute)
- 📊 Observability layer (append-only truth)
- 🔐 Data layer (secrets never leave without authorization)
- ⚡ 4 months from zero to production

### 🔬 Research
Novel approaches to AI context management. How do you make AI remember what it's *not* allowed to forget? Working prototypes. More soon.

## 🛤️ The Journey

```
2009-2024: 15 years away from tech. Life happened.
2024:      Recovery. Mental health journey. Fresh start.
2024:      Back to school — Cybersecurity (Freshman)
2024:      Started building. Couldn't stop.
2025:      4 months in: 6,000+ nodes, multi-service architecture
```

💡 **Recovery taught me that systems need guardrails — including AI systems.**
